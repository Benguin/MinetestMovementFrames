# Movement Frames
A mod that adds RedPower / ProjectRed movement frames to minetest. 

This is my first mod, it is not in ship-shape, use it at your own peril.

Based heavily on Mesecons movestone code (all credit to the original author @ http://mesecons.net/ )

# New Blocks
This mod adds 2 blocks.

## Movers 
A mover can be placed in any orientation, and will move whichever block is in 'front' of it in the direction its arrow is pointing, as long as it is being powered by a mese signal. If a frame block is moved, it will move all neighboring blocks too.

## Frames
A frame block will push/pull/drag its neighbours with it (excluding movers and non-movable blocks defined by mesecons). Each side can be configured independently  as being sticky/non-sticky. To set a side as non-sticky, right click it with some chalk. To set it as sticky, right click it with glue.
